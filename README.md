Project Proposal
-----------------------
- We have chosen to look into volcano and earthquake data to explore relationships visually, inspired by the earthquake in-class assignment using Leaflet. 
- Datasets: https://www.kaggle.com/usgs/earthquake-database , https://www.kaggle.com/texasdave/volcano-eruptions
- Relevant, inspring visualizations: 
- Final Sketch: ETL using python/pandas + SQL/SQLite --> Flask-API --> Heroku --> HTML + CSS + JavaScript and Plotly/D3 --> Leaflet map?
- Visualization plans: Leaflet map with volcano and earthquake data overlapping, other plotly visualizations with earthquake magnitude vs year, volcano data: country(look at locations... are there specific areas with more, etc), deaths/inuries, total damage/total houses destroyed, etc.
- GitHub Repo: https://github.com/mdaxc6/databootcamp_project_2
